        This document is a draft specification developed by PolygonID and is provided for public review and feedback. The current version of the document is a work in progress and may be subject to changes or updates based on community input, technical advancements, or further research.

        The specification has not yet been submitted to, reviewed, or approved by any formal standards organization such as the W3C. However, it is intended to align closely with the existing W3C recommendations, specifications, and best practices related to decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, and digital signatures.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification presents the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite, created in 2021 for the Verifiable Credentials Data Integrity Proof specification. The suite employs EdDSA on the BabyJubJub curve as the signature algorithm, providing an efficient structure for signing and verifying credentials while being zk-friendly.

        Although the signature suite itself does not actively involve zero-knowledge proofs, its design is conducive to privacy-preserving computations and can be easily integrated with zkSNARKs and other zero-knowledge proof systems. This document details the components, structure, and implementation guidance for the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite, catering to developers, implementers, and users.

            A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of a
            canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a
            signature algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for
            developers for the purposes of safety and convenience.

            3) cause the output to change significantly when even one bit of the

            <li>Then for each Quad, we build key-value where the key is the full type path, and the value is the value of the entry </li>

          We require the input document to the merklization algorithem to be expanded and canonilaized.

        <p>
          Signatures are generated using the following algorithm:
          <ol>
            <li>Expand the JSON-LD document using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#expansion">JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms</a></li>

        <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          When implementing the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite, several security considerations must be taken into account to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system.
        </p>

        <section id="security-considerations-key-management">
          <h4>Key Management</h4>
          <p>
            Proper key management practices must be followed to ensure the security of private keys. This includes secure key generation, storage, and destruction. It is essential to protect private keys from unauthorized access, as the loss or compromise of a private key could lead to impersonation or unauthorized access to signed documents.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="security-considerations-cryptographic-security">
          <h4>Cryptographic Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            The security of the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite is dependent on the underlying cryptographic algorithms (Poseidon hash function and BabyJubJub signature algorithm). It is crucial to ensure that the chosen algorithms have been thoroughly analyzed and deemed secure by the cryptographic community.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="security-considerations-merkalization">
          <h4>Document Merklization</h4>
          <p>
            The Merklization process should be carefully implemented and reviewed to ensure that it preserves the integrity of the document while allowing for efficient zero-knowledge proofs. Any vulnerabilities in the Merklization algorithm could compromise the integrity of the signed document or the privacy of the zkSNARK proofs.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="security-considerations-side-channel">
          <h4>Side Channel Attacks</h4>
          <p>
            Implementations of the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite should be designed to be resistant to side-channel attacks. These attacks could involve timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic radiation analysis to extract secret information from the system. Proper countermeasures should be employed to prevent such attacks.

      <!-- <section id="privacy-considerations">
        <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          In the basic form of the BabyJubjub 2021 signature suite it provides the usual behvoir of a signature scheme, the prover needs to share with the verifier the document (aka the message), the signature and the public key of the issuer. 
          This signature suite was secialisy designed to be comptabily and effcient in a zkSNARK setting, due to this design choice we prove a valid signature from an issuer without disclosing the signature nor the document and enhance the holder privacy termndesulay.
